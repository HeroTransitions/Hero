## Introduction

**Hero** is a library for building iOS view controller transitions. It provides a layer on top of the UIKit's cumbersome transition APIs. Making custom transitions an easy task for developers.

### Features

#### With Hero, you can easily mix & match these effects to build your own custom transition.

At its core, Hero is similar to Keynote's `Magic Move`. It checks the `heroID` property on all source and destinations views. Every matched view pairs are then automatically transitioned from it's old state to it's new state.

Hero can also construct animations for unmatched views. It is easy to define these animations via the `heroModifiers` property. Hero will run these animations alongside the `Magic Move` animations. All of these can be interactive, too.

Hero does not make any assumption about how the view is built or structured. It will not modify any of your views' states other than hiding them during the animation. This means that it works with autolayout, programmatic layout, UICollectionView, UITableView, UINavigationController etc... 

##### NOTE: Hero won't work on iPhone 7 Simulators due to a [bug](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/63438) by Apple. Try using other simulators or a real device when working with Hero.
